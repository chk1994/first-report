# Tool Assessment

## Application Integration

To send data over HTTP (i.e. communication between the client and the server), we can use either GraphQL or REST. Using either GraphQL or REST for development allows for Separation of Concerns, where the client-side code will not concern itself with writing SQL statements or the logic for accessing the database. Rather, it will only largely concern itself with the View. Furthermore, by having Separation of Concerns: 
1. Development of user interface, the server and the data storage can be performed independently as they are loosely coupled to each other.
1. Debugging and spotting security flaws in our project becomes easier.

We have decided to use GraphQL over REST as REST faces the following issues:
1. Overfetching: Client downloads more information than is required.
1. Underfetching: A specific endpoint doesn’t provide enough required information. This means that the client has to make multiple API calls through various endpoints to retrieve the required information.
1. Slowing development: As we aren't clear about the requirements / data to be displayed to the various users, we may need many iterations of user testing to verify that the data displayed to each user is sufficient. By using REST, apart from changing the UI, the backend also needs to be updated to return the correct data. This is not the case for GraphQL.
1. Harder to pick up: [Good API](https://blog.goodapi.co/rest-vs-graphql-a-critical-review-5f77392658e7) commented that "when time is the essence... when only one client that you control consumes your API, when you can’t afford to study REST or to learn HTTP in-depth or when you can’t hire someone with the expertise to help you, GraphQL might be the better way to go" simply because "True REST APIs are incredibly hard to pull off."

Our project uses [Spring framework](https://spring.io/) to create a web service using [GraphQL](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-graphql):
1. Spring allows us to easily [connect and perform operations to a MySQL database](https://dev.to/sambenskin/howto-integrate-a-mysql-database-into-your-java-spring-boot-graphql-service-26c).
1. Spring works on Java platform, and most of us are familiar with Java.

## Anonymising Data

The purpose of [anonymising](http://kau.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1043735/FULLTEXT01.pdf) data is to make it impossible to:
1. Single out an individual in the dataset. 
1. Link records concerning the same individual.
1. Infer the value of one attribute based on other values.

This allows for researchers to retrieve data for research purposes without violating privacy concerns.

There are 3 ways to ensure anonymity of data:
1. [k-anonymity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity). This is implemented by:
    1. Suppression. For instance, all or some values of a particular column may be omitted through replacing it with a "\*".
    1. Generalisation. For instance, the medical condition can be replaced by a more general term (e.g., “Cardiovascular disease” replaced by “Heart-related”).
    
    An example of pre-anonymised data:
    
    ![pre-anonymised data](https://github.com/IFS4205-2018-Sem1-Team1/first-report/raw/master/images/pre_anonymisation.png)
    
    After applying 2-anonymity to the data. Notice that this data has 2-anonymity with respect to the attributes "Age" and "Gender", but not for the attribute "Disease":
    
    ![post-anonymised data](https://github.com/IFS4205-2018-Sem1-Team1/first-report/raw/master/images/post_anonymisation.png)

1. [Adding noise to the data](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40537-017-0110-7). This can be implemented by swapping cells within columns.

1. Generating fake data. The fake data must be a good representation of the actual data.

Since anonymising data is not the key focus of the project, we decided not to spend implement the algorithms if possible. Out of the 3 methods, only k-anonymity has an existing well-established [library](https://arx.deidentifier.org/overview/), complete with [examples](https://github.com/arx-deidentifier/arx/tree/master/src/example/org/deidentifier/arx/examples). Therefore, we've decided to use k-anonymity.

## Encryption

The purpose of [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) is to ensure data transfer traffic is not susceptible to potential interceptors. Encryption will be used when data is transferred between the 3 different servers, namely front-end, back-end, and database.

Example of encryption:
![encryption-example](https://github.com/IFS4205-2018-Sem1-Team1/first-report/raw/master/images/public_key_encryption_keys.png)

There is a useful cryptographic class for use in [Java Platform SE 10](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/javax/crypto/Cipher.html):
1. Symmetric Key Encryption (AES)
1. Asymmetric Key Encrytion (RSA)

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric algorithm (private-key cryptography). This involves a single key which is a shared secret between the sender and recipient. The same key is being used for both encryption and decryption. Public-key cryptography (PKI), a asymmetric algorithm, involves two related keys for each recipient involved - a private key which is a secret known only by the recipient, and a related public key which is known by all senders. The sender encrypts the message using the recipient's public key. That message can only be decrypted by a recipient with a private key matching the public key. We will be using RSA for our asymmetric algorithm.

For simplicity and efficient encryption, we can employ the use of AES with a single secret key for encryption and decryption. The secret key used has to be stored in a safe location to prevent any potential compromise. We propose to lock it in a password protected .config file that outsiders are unable to access.

Possible library alternatives:
1. [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/refs.crypto.php)
1. [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/crypto.html)
1. [Perl](https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/crypt.html)

AES [example](https://aesencryption.net/).

## Source Code Control & Issue Management

Our project uses [GitHub](https://github.com/IFS4205-2018-Sem1-Team1) for source code control and issue management for the following reasons:
1. It's a good tool for project management.
1. Most of the team are familiar and comfortable with using GitHub. This is not the case for the alternatives.

There are other alternatives such as:
1. Bitbucket. It allows free hosting of private repositories. However, the free version only allows for up to 5 users per repository. As our team has 6 members, we are not able to use the free version. Furthermore, there is no requirement for us to host our code on private repositories.
1. GitLab. GitLab has inbuilt CI/CD. This means that we do not have to manually integrate external CI/CD such as Travis to our repositories. This is a plus point, though, not a very big one since it's easy to perform manual integration of external CI/CD. 
Also, GitLab is lacking some features compared to GitHub such as having only a single assignee for issues. Since some issues may be quite hard to resolve, we may need to use GitHub's feature of having multiple assignees for issues. 
Therefore, there's no compelling reason for us to use GitLab over GitHub.

Reports will be written in .md (instead of .doc) to allow for version control of reports as well.

## DevOps Tools

###Configuration Management Tool
Our project will use [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) as our configuration management tool to ensure that our remote servers are set up properly and simply.  [This doc](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/user_guide/intro_getting_started.html) will help us with setting up. A configuration management tool is great for our project as we are managing 3 remote servers with different functionalities, most likely serving their roles as a web server, an application server and a database server. The most popular configuration management tools out there are Ansible, Salt, Puppet, and Chef. Puppet and Chef are pull-based configuration management tools so that means that they pull all the configurations from a central server, which will not serve our needs. They also constrict users to using Ruby. Ansible and Salt, on the other hand, are push-based configuration tools which means users can directly push their configurations onto their node machines. We chose Ansible over Salt as Ansible has excellent security using SSH. It also has a less steep learning curve than Salt, which is important given that we do not have experience with these tools. 

## Security Tools

To scan our web application for vulnerabilities like XSS, we will use [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/). [This article by Upguard](https://www.upguard.com/articles/arachni-vs-owasp-zap) makes a comparison between two of the most popular web application pen testing tools - Arachni and OWASP ZAP and we have decided on ZAP as they have more extensive community resources. They are both open source/ free, and have about the same set of functionalities. 

To find and fix known vulnerabilities in open-source dependencies, we would also use [Synk](https://github.com/Snyk/) as this can be integrated easily with our Github repo. Another alternative is SourceClear but it is not free and Synk is a good alternative to SourceClear. 

As we would need to uphold our security claims to our users, we will also consider using [BDD-Security](https://www.continuumsecurity.net/bdd-security/) to launch automated scans with these specific security claims.
